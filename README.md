# Marketing-Agency-Design

I wanted a quick challenge, so I looked up for designs on Dribbble and I found this design. Added a contact section and a footer. When the responsive was less showed on the design, I imagined my own. <br>
It was the first time I used the Slick carousel library, I really wanted to try it and dive a bit into their documentation.

## Project presentation:
